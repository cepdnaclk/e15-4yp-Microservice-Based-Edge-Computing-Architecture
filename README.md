## Microservice based Edge Computing Architecture

Distributed computation and AI processing at the edge has been identified as an efficient solution to deliver realtime IoT services and applications compared to cloud-based paradigms. These solutions are expected to support the delaysensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart
service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation
and data processing at the edge; concurrent and realtime application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Hence, first, we propose a novel three-layer architecture that facilitates the above service requirements. Then we have developed a novel platform and relevant modules with integrated
AI processing and edge computer paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component is designed to handle
the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed platform is tested
and have been verified.
