## Microservice based Edge Computing Architecture

Recent research has given much emphasis on realizing AI computing at the edge in contrast to cloud computing approaches to support the delay-sensitive IoT applications, autonomic decision making, and smart service creation at the edge in comparison to traditional IoT solutions. However, existing solutions have limitations concerning distributed and simultaneous resource management for AI computation and data processing at the edge; concurrent and real-time application execution; and platform-independent deployment. Thus, in this work, a novel framework and relevant modules are to be investigated that integrates real-time AI processing and edge computing paradigms considering issues related to scalability, heterogeneity, security, and interoperability of IoT services. Further, each component must be uniquely designed to handle the control signals, data flows, microservice orchestration, and resource composition to match with the IoT application requirements.

In this research, we have developed an application-level model (for autonomous cars) to test out the model. The model consists of three hierarchies as Edge, Fog, and cloud to do the data processing and we have been able to show that with microservice enabled AI computation it is possible to do the data processing at the edge level with help of several nodes.
